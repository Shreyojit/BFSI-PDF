ADOPTION AGREEMENT #006

STANDARDIZED 401(k) PLAN

The undersigned Employer, by executing this Adoption Agreement, establishes a retirement plan and trust (collectively "Plan") under the Defined Contribution Prototypic Plan and Trust, (basic plan document #11). The Employer, subject to the Employer's Adoption Agreement elections, adopts fully the Prototypic Plan and Trust provisions. This Adoption Agreement, the basic plan document and any attached Appendices or agreements permitted or referenced therein, constitute the Employer's entire plan and trust document. All "Election" references within this Adoption Agreement are Adoption Agreement Elections. All "Article" or "Section" references are basic plan document references. Numbers in parentheses which follow election numbers are basic plan document references. Where an Adoption Agreement election calls for the Employer to supply text, the Employer (without altering the content of any existing printed text) may lengthen any space or line, or create additional lines. When Employer-supplied text uses terms substantially similar to existing printed options, all clarifications and caveats applicable to the printed options apply to the Employer-supplied text unless the context requires otherwise. The Employer makes the following elections granted under the corresponding provisions of the basic plan document. The Employer should complete this Adoption Agreement in a manner which is consistent with the restrictions contained in Rev. Proc. 2011-49 as applicable to Standardized Plans. For example, all benefits, rights and features must be currently available to all Participants, allocation compensation must be nondiscriminatory, the eligibility requirements for HCEs may not be more favorable than for NHCEs and certain other conditions and limitations apply. Failure to observe these restrictions may result in loss of reliance on the Plan's Opinion Letter.
