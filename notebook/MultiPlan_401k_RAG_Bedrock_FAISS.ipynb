    "### 🔴 ABSOLUTE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\n",
    "\n",
    "1) ✅ **CHECKBOX LOGIC IS LAW**:\n",
    "   - \"[x]\" or \"[X]\" = SELECTED\n",
    "   - \"[ ]\" = NOT SELECTED\n",
    "   - If a section says \"Choose one of (a) or (b)\", and (a) is checked, then (b) **does not apply**, even if text from (b) is present.\n",
    "   - If a section says \"Do not apply\" and it is checked, then the entire feature is **OFF** — do **not** describe rates, formulas, or schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) 🚫 **NO HALLUCINATIONS**:\n",
    "   - If a feature is disabled (e.g., \"Do not apply\" is checked), do **not** describe its parameters.\n",
    "   - If no percentage, formula, or amount is specified, return \"not specified\" — do **not** invent numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) 📌 **FOLLOW SKIP INSTRUCTIONS**:\n",
    "   - If a line says \"(skip to Election X)\" and the option is checked, then all later elections (e.g., 21(b), 21(3), 34) are **irrelevant and not in effect**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) 🔍 **CONTEXT IS KING**:\n",
    "   - Do **not** use outside knowledge (IRS rules, common practices, defaults).\n",
    "   - If something is not explicitly checked or filled, it is **not part of the plan**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) 🧩 PER-PLAN ISOLATION:\n",
    "   - Answer for each plan **independently**. Never assume one plan’s election applies to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) 📎 CITATIONS:\n",
    "   - Cite only the section/election label and page where the answer is found.\n",
    "   - If multiple citations, list all that directly support the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) 📏 NORMALIZATION:\n",
    "   - Convert terms: \"3 months\" → \"3 months\", \"1,000 hours\" → \"1,000 Hours of Service\", \"50%\" → \"50% of Compensation\".\n",
