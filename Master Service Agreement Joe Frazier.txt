### 1. Introduction

<<Service Provider>> offers a full range of qualified retirement plan administration support services to our clients under the terms and conditions set forth in this Master Agreement and the other documents described below.

When you sign an authorization regarding the services, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Agreement. In addition, if you use or attempt to use any service, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Agreement relating to that service, even if you have not signed an authorization or service schedule for that service.

### 2. Organization of Agreement

As indicated above, the Agreement is made up of several documents, each of which serves a special purpose. The relevant documents and their purposes are as follows:

- **Service Schedules.** There is a service schedule for certain services describing the nature and scope of the specific service, as well as the specific terms and conditions relating to that service. Certain Service Schedules may also contain required implementation/set-up information needed by us for operational purposes for the services you have elected to use or have supplemental addendums for specific services.

- **Master Agreement.** This Master Agreement sets forth the rights and responsibilities that you and we have agreed to with respect to the services that we offer and addresses issues that are common to all services. All Service Schedules elected by you are part of and incorporated in the Master Agreement by reference.

**7. Information Provided to Us.**  
You, as Plan Administrator and Plan Sponsor, agree to provide us with such documents, instructions, information, and advice at such times and in such form and manner as we may request, including, but not limited to, the identity of “key employees,” “former key employees” and “highly compensated employees” as defined under the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”). You acknowledge and agree that any delay in providing such documents, instructions, information or advice to us may result in a delay in the service we provide and may result in additional fees or expense and possible penalties under applicable federal law. You further acknowledge that all determinations, summaries, statements, and reports made or prepared by us in accordance with this Agreement will be made or prepared solely from the documents, instructions, information and advice provided to us by you, or your advisors or agents. You agree that we may rely completely upon such documents, instructions, information, or advice and are under no obligation whatsoever to verify the accuracy or completeness thereof. You also agree to comply with all of the rules and procedure schedules attached to this Master Agreement as they may be amended from time to time. You grant us permission to list your Plan as a reference when we respond to requests for proposals. To the extent applicable, you authorize us to share with third parties the information regarding the Plan and participants necessary for those third parties to perform the optional services which have been selected in Section 3 above.

---

**8. No Other Plans.**  
You understand and acknowledge that any determinations we make or services we provide hereunder may be erroneous or invalid under the Code or other law if you or any organization that is or was considered to be a single employer with you under Code Sections 414(b), 414(c), 414(m) or 414(o) (“Controlled Group”) maintains or ever maintained some other plan that was qualified under Code Section 401(a). You further understand and agree that in performing services under this Agreement, we will assume that the Plan is the only plan described under Code Section 401(a) that is or has at any time been maintained by you or any organization that is a member of such a Controlled Group unless you have notified us of the existence of other qualified plans you maintain and have given us the opportunity to determine the effect of such other plan(s) on the administration and recordkeeping of any other plan we service for you. If you identify any other such plans that should be considered with this Plan, we will take those plans into consideration provided those plans are subject to a <<Provider Reference>> Total Retirement Solutions Master Agreement. We have no responsibility hereunder whatsoever for performing any service under this Agreement if the performance of that service would require us to (a) consider another plan that is not subject to a <<Provider Reference>> Total Retirement Solutions Master Agreement or (b) consider the benefits provided under a defined benefit plan (whether or not frozen or terminated) currently maintained or ever maintained by you or any member of a Controlled Group that includes you unless you have elected the defined benefit service schedule provided for in Section 3.

---

**9. We Serve As Your Agent.**  
You acknowledge and agree that (a) we are performing all services under this Agreement solely as your agent; (b) we are not the “Plan Administrator” or “named fiduciary” for the Plan as provided for under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), or the Code; (c) the duties and responsibilities assigned to us herein are not intended to and do not convey any apparent, express or implied discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting the management of the Plan or the management, investment or disposition of Plan assets or any responsibility for your Plan’s legal claim for delinquent contributions; and (d) while serving you under this Agreement, neither we nor you intend that we shall be a fiduciary of the Plan, as defined under Section 3(21) of ERISA unless we agree in writing to accept such designation. In addition to serving as your agent under this Agreement, we may agree to also serve as your directed trustee, or in another capacity for which you appoint us. Our serving in any capacity other than as your agent under this agreement requires separate written agreements which are in addition to this Agreement.

---

**10. Duties Not Delegated to Us.**  
You acknowledge and agree that agent’s sole duties and responsibilities with respect to your Plan under this Agreement shall be limited to those ministerial, nondiscretionary services described in the separate service schedules you have elected for your Plan. Further, you acknowledge and agree that any other duties or responsibilities regarding the management or administration of the Plan including, but not limited to:

a. Developing a funding policy;  
b. Interpreting and administering the Plan;  
c. Determining eligibility for benefits (when, to whom, and in what form Plan distributions should be made) or eligibility to participate in elective deferrals under the Plan (provided, however, that determining eligibility for employer contributions as provided in Section 5E of the MSA for 401(k) may be contracted to us);  
d. Resolving disputed participant claims and appeals;  
e. Complying with applicable reporting and disclosure requirements (other than compiling information and preparing drafts as set forth in this Agreement or under an applicable Services Schedule);  
f. Being responsible for or performing any calculation of an actuarial nature or any benefit calculation or function normally and customarily performed by an actuary;  
g. Providing sample notices regarding any optional forms of payment available under the Plan and waiver of rights with respect to any annuity forms of payment (both pre-retirement survivor annuities and post-retirement joint and survivor annuities) under the Plan, as may be required under Code Sections 401(a)(11), 411 and 417 (Plan Sponsor should consult with its legal counsel regarding suitability of form and legal notices; <<Provider Reference>> does not provide tax or legal advice);  
h. Retaining information, files and documents required to administer the Plan or perform any service provided for in this Agreement, and to satisfy applicable law, including, but not limited to participant beneficiary designation forms, benefit election forms, etc. File retention shall be the responsibility of the Plan Sponsor;

**11. Liability and Indemnification.**  
<<Provider Reference>> may rely upon and act upon any writing from any person authorized by the Plan Sponsor to give instructions concerning the Plan and may conclusively rely upon and be protected in acting upon any written order from the Plan Sponsor or upon any other notice, consent, request, certificate, or other instructions or paper reasonably believed by it to have been executed by a duly authorized person, so long as it acts in good faith in taking or omitting to take any such action. <<Provider Reference>> need not inquire as to the basis in fact of any statement in writing received from the Plan Sponsor or any other party authorized by the Plan Sponsor to act with respect to the Plan. <<Provider Reference>> shall be entitled to rely upon the information provided by the Plan Sponsor in performance of its duties hereunder.

<<Provider Reference>> and the Plan Sponsor shall each solely (the “indemnifying party”) indemnify and hold the other (the “indemnified party”) harmless against any and all liabilities, losses, costs, damages, or expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of whatsoever kind and nature which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the indemnified party at any time to the extent such liability, loss or expense results from the indemnifying party’s negligence, breach of the terms hereof, or willful misconduct under this Agreement. Except as specifically provided in the preceding sentence, the Plan Sponsor shall indemnify and hold <<Provider Reference>> harmless against any and all liabilities, losses, costs, damages, or expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) of whatsoever kind and nature which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against <<Provider Reference>> at any time in connection with (i) services performed by <<Provider Reference>> in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (ii) <<Provider Reference>>’s having entered into this Agreement; (iii) <<Provider Reference>>’s having acted upon the directions of the Plan Sponsor hereunder; or (iv) <<Provider Reference>>’s having failed to act as a result of either the Plan Sponsor’s directions not to act or the absence of Plan Sponsor directions. For purposes of this Section 11, any reference to <<Provider Reference>> or the Plan Sponsor as an indemnified party shall be deemed to include their respective directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, and subsidiaries.

In addition to the foregoing, in the event the Plan Sponsor directs <<Provider Reference>> to make distributions upon the termination of a Plan qualified under IRC § 401(a) without the Plan Sponsor having obtained a current letter of favorable determination upon termination from the Internal Revenue Service, the Plan Sponsor is deemed under this Agreement to represent to <<Provider Reference>> that the Plan is in compliance with all applicable requirements of the Code and ERISA, and the Plan Sponsor shall indemnify and hold <<Provider Reference>> and its officer, directors, employees, agents and successors, or assigns harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, claims, damages, costs or expenses arising out of or in any way related, directly or indirectly, to making such distributions without a favorable determination letter upon termination, to the adequacy of any Plan documents provided to <<Provider Reference>>, or to the Plan’s compliance or noncompliance with the provisions of ERISA or the Code. This further indemnification shall be binding upon the Plan Sponsor and its successors or assigns, and shall cover all expenses incurred by the <<Provider Reference>>, including but not limited to, court costs, attorney’s fees and any other expenses related to any investigation, inquiry, action or determination by a court or governmental agency regarding the Plan’s compliance or noncompliance with the provisions of ERISA or any other applicable law.

**This paragraph 11 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.**

---

**12. Arbitration.**  
Either you or we have the right to require that any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreement or any breach, termination or invalidity thereof, including any dispute concerning the scope of this arbitration clause, be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with Title 9 of the United States Code and the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any arbitration proceeding will be conducted before a panel of three neutral arbitrators, or one neutral arbitrator if the amount in dispute does not exceed $500,000, all of whom must be attorneys engaged in the practice of ERISA law for ten years or more. You and we will each select one arbitrator, or if the arbitration is conducted by only one arbitrator you and we will jointly select the arbitrator. The arbitrator that you select and the arbitrator that we select will, within ten days of their appointment, select a third, neutral arbitrator. In the event that they are unable to do so, you, we or either of our attorneys may request the American Arbitration Association to appoint the third neutral arbitrator. Prior to the commencement of hearings, each of the arbitrators appointed must take an oath of impartiality. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The place of the arbitration will be in the city where our principal office is located. In rendering any award, the arbitrators will determine the rights and obligations of the parties in accordance with the laws of the state governing this Agreement except to the extent that they may be preempted by the laws of the United States. The arbitrators are not empowered to award damages in excess of the amounts expressly provided for by this Master Agreement. All statutes of limitation that would otherwise apply to a judicial action will apply to any arbitration or reference proceeding under the Agreement. The arbitrators must award to the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the arbitrators, all of its costs and fees. “Costs and fees” means all reasonable pre-award expenses of the arbitration, including the arbitrator’s fee, travel expenses, out-of-pocket expenses such as copying and telephone, court costs, witness fees and attorneys’ fees. Neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or result of any arbitration under the Agreement without the prior written consent of the other.

**13. Jury Trial Waiver.**  
You and we both knowingly, voluntarily, intentionally and irrevocably waive any right to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation based on, arising out of or relating to the Agreement, the services, or any other document, instrument, transaction, course of conduct, course of dealing, statements (whether verbal or written) or your or our actions. This provision is a material inducement for us to enter into the Agreement. You also acknowledge that none of our representatives or agents has represented that we would not seek to enforce this jury trial waiver in the event of any litigation.

All statements for Fees and Expenses shall be directed to you at the address you provide to us. You hereby consent to the payment of such Fees and Expenses from the assets of the Plan and hereby authorize and direct the trustee of the Plan to pay such amounts upon written demand by us, provided that the terms of the Plan permit the payment of such items. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may pay Fees and Expenses on or before the due date indicated on the statement. Unless you object in writing to the Fees and Expenses shown on the statement within thirty (30) days of the invoice date, you will be deemed to have assented to such Fees and Expenses and we will be forever discharged and released from any liability or accountability with respect to such Fees and Expenses. You further acknowledge and agree that Fees for services provided to Plan participants by third parties for optional services contracted outside this agreement (including but not limited to Participant Advisory Services and Self-Directed Brokerage Accounts (SDBA)) shall be paid from the accounts of participants using those services to the third party to the extent consistent with agreements between those participants and the third party.
